<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>1½ lb boneless, skinless chicken</li>
    <li>¼ tsp kosher or sea salt</li>
    <li>freshly ground black pepper</li>
    <li>2 carrots</li>
    <li>2 onions</li>
    <li>3 Yukon gold potatoes</li>
    <li>1 knob ginger</li>
    <li>2 cloves garlic</li>
    <li>½ apple</li>
    <li>1½ Tbsp neutral-flavored oil</li>
    <li>4 cups Chicken Stock/Broth</li>
    <li>1 Tbsp honey</li>
    <li>1 Tbsp soy sauce</li>
    <li>1 Tbsp ketchup</li>
    <li>1 package Japanese curry roux</li>
    <li>2-4 tsp kosher or sea salt</li>
</ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Cut the onions into wedges.</li>
    <li>Peel the carrots and cut them into rolling wedges.</li>
    <li>Peel the potatoes. Cut each potato into quarters (6 pieces for russet potatoes). Soak them in water for 15 minutes to remove excess starch.</li>
    <li>Grate the ginger. You will need 1 tsp of grated ginger, including the juice. Mince the garlic and set aside.</li>
    <li>Cut the apple into quarters, remove the core, and peel the skin.</li>
    <li>Grate the apple.</li>
    <li>Cut off the extra fat from the chicken and discard it. Then cut the chicken into bite-sized pieces. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
    <li>Heat the oil in a large pot over medium heat and add the onion.</li>
    <li>Sauté the onions, stirring occasionally, until they become translucent and tender, about 5 minutes.</li>
    <li>Add the minced garlic and grated ginger and mix well together.</li>
    <li>Add the chicken and cook, stirring frequently, until it's no longer pink on the outside.</li>
    <li>Add the chicken stock.</li>
    <li>Add the grated apple, honey, soy sauce, and ketchup.</li>
    <li>Add the carrots and potatoes. The broth should barely cover the ingredients.</li>
    <li>Simmer, covered, on medium-low heat for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
    <li>Once boiling, use a fine-mesh strainer to skim the scum and foam from the surface of the broth.</li>
    <li>Continue to cook covered until a wooden skewer goes through the carrots and potatoes.</li>
    <li>Turn off the heat. Put 1-2 cubes of roux in a ladleful of cooking liquid, slowly let it dissolve with a spoon or chopsticks, and stir into the pot to incorporate. Repeat with the rest of the blocks, 2 cubes at a time.</li>
    <li>Simmer, uncovered, on medium-low heat, stirring frequently, until the curry becomes thick, about 5-10 minutes.</li>
    <li>Serve the curry with steamed Japanese short-grain rice on the side. If you like, garnish with fukujinzuke.</li>
